Tests: Semantic Errors - problems with declaring, redeclaring and using an unknown type
Written by: Group 4
-----------------------------------

Location and Description of Errors
-----------------------------------
In this test a variable is declared using a name which is already declared as a 
type on line 36. A variable is defined using an unknown type on line 40, and 
another is declared twice in the same scope on line 43.
