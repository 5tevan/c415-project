Test Program 0.pal 
Tests: Semantic Errors - declarations using reserve words
Written by: Group 4
-----------------------------------

Location and Description of Errors
-----------------------------------
The errors in this program are all found in different declarations.  The first error can be
found on line 16, where the reserve word "mod" is given as the program name.
The second error can be found on line 24.  The reserve word "while" is used to declare a constant.
Lastly the third error can be found on line 33, the reserve word "program" is used to declare a type.
