Description
-----------------------------------
#All the errors from 8.pal - There are record errors on lines 33 & 35, an array error on line 59,
and an incorrect assignment attempt on line 78.

#plus - duplicate field in a record line 55.  Attempt at returning incorrect type in
a function on line 68. 'exit' found outside a loop on line 80.  
Assigning to a record field which does not exist on line 82.
