Test Program 0.pal 
Tests: Syntax errors in type declarations
Written by: Group 4
-----------------------------------


Location and Description of Errors
-----------------------------------
There are three syntax errors in this program.  They 
are all found in the type declaration field on lines 32, 33, and 35.  
The first error is the improper declaration of type "int" to "intger".
This error is propagated forward into the types "int1"
and "index", who are declared as the incorrect type "int".
